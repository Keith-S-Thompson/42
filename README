This small C program demonstrates the danger of improper use of the
C preprocessor.

A macro that's intended to be used in an expression context generally
needs to be aggressively parenthesized.  You should have parentheses
around each reference to a macro parameter, and around the entire definition.

The reason is that macro expansion works on sequences of tokens.
The C preprocessor doesn't deal with high-level C syntax.

In the example, the macro SIX expands to the token sequence 1 + 5,
and the macro NINE expands to 8 + 1.  If each of these expressions
were evaluated on its own, the results would be 6 and 9, respectively,
But when they'e combined in the expression SIX * NINE, the expansion is:

    1+5*8+1

which is equivalent to:

    1+(5*8)+1

or 42.

The program is also a reference to a joke in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, by Douglas Adams:
